Reverse an integer. Suppose we input an integer 123456789, then output is 987654321.

This is a question I saw online, only use basic math to solve the problem. The code for this question is not challenging at all, but the thinking
is the key to solve it. The beauty of the problem is to use simple math to solve it.
We update the integer by deviding 10, and record each remainder before the deviding. 

######### Solution #########

def reverse_integer(number):
    if not number:
        return
    result=[]  # result is used to store each digit in number in original order
    while number>=10:
        result.insert(0,number % 10) # use insert(0,x) function to keep the original order
        number =  number / 10 # update number
    result.insert(0,number)  # do not forget to store the first last digit in number
    ans=0
    for i in range(0,len(result)):
        ans = ans + result[i] * (10 ** i)  
    return ans
    
print reverse_integer(123456789)
